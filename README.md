# Deep Learning Nanodegree 

This repository contains all the projects I worked on while finishing Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. I created various models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs.

All these projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, and are successfully submitted and passed.

## Projects

* [Neural Network](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/master/Neural_Network): Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/master/Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN): Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
* [TV_Script_generation_RNN](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/master/TV_Script_generation_RNN): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [Face_Generation_GAN](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/master/Face_Generation_GAN): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
* [Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM_Model_Deployment_AWS_Sagemaker](https://github.com/rishabhmohan/Deep_Learning_Nanodegree/tree/master/Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM_Model_Deployment_AWS_Sagemaker): Deploy a LSTM model to analyze sentiments using AWS sagemaker and various other AWS services like lambda, API gateway
